# React + Vite + Tailwind + React Router

This uses React with Vite. I've also added React Router and Tailwind to make it easier to put together quickly. Their docs are linked below. You don't need to use Tailwind if you're more comfortable using straight CSS for the pages you work on, it's just preference.

You need npm if you plan on doing anything here. To run the project, just cd into this folder, then run:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Once you've done this, your terminal will give you a localhost address you should be able to open in your browser.
